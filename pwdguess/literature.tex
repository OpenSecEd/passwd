Before doing this laboratory assignment you should read Chap.~2 ``Usability and 
Psychology'' and Chap.~5 ``Cryptography'' in 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
Further, you need a basic understanding of information 
theory~\cite{Shannon1948amt} for this assignment, for this you are recommended 
to read \citetitle{Ueltschi2013se}~\cite{Ueltschi2013se}.

Now that you have the basic theory, you should start reading the main material 
of this assignment.
Start by reading the papers \citetitle{Kuo2006hso}~\cite{Kuo2006hso} and 
\citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa}.
You should then read the follow-up paper to the latter: 
\citetitle{Komanduri2014can}~\cite{Komanduri2014can}.
Finally, you should read \citetitle{kelley2012guess}~\cite{kelley2012guess}.

After that you should read about some recent incidents where password databases 
have leaked.
There is a list of breaches maintained by the \enquote{Have I been pwned} 
service\footnote{%
  URL: \url{https://haveibeenpwned.com/}.
}, you can search for news articles to read the details.
(And we encourage you to use this service.)

For a more in-depth treatment on password guessing, you are recommended to read 
\citetitle{Bonneau2012ghs} by \citet{Bonneau2012ghs}.
However, this is not a mandatory part of the assignment.

The final part of the theory concerns social engineering.
You should read about an incident striking the security company RSA, covered in 
\citetitle{Fisher2011rsa}~\cite{Fisher2011rsa}.
