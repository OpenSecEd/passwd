Before doing this laboratory assignment you should read Chap.~2 ``Usability and 
Psychology'' and Chap.~5 ``Cryptography'' in \citetitle{Anderson2008sea} 
\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
Further, you need a basic understanding of information theory 
\cite{Shannon1948amt} for this assignment, for this you are recommended to read 
\citetitle{Ueltschi2013se}~\cite{Ueltschi2013se}.

Now that you have the basic theory, you should start reading the main material 
of this assignment.
Start by reading the papers \citetitle{Kuo2006hso}~\cite{Kuo2006hso} and 
\citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa}.
You should then read the follow-up paper to the latter: 
\citetitle{Komanduri2014can}~\cite{Komanduri2014can}.
After that you should read about some recent incidents where password databases 
have leaked, 
e.g.~\cite{Hunt2011abs,Cluley2012twp,Oberheide2010bao,Cubrilovic2009rhf}.

For a more in-depth treatment on password guessing, you are recommended to read 
\citetitle{Bonneau2012ghs} by \citet{Bonneau2012ghs}.
However, this is not a mandatory part of the assignment.

The final part of the theory concerns \acp{APT}.
You should read about these.
First you should read about an incident striking the security company RSA, 
covered in \citetitle{Fisher2011rsa}~\cite{Fisher2011rsa}.
Then you will read a paper on different approaches to \ac{APT}, 
\citetitle{Juels2012sha} by \citet{Juels2012sha}.
