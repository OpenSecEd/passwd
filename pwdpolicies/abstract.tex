The part of security that perhaps most affect the users is user authentication.
The predominant mechanism to achieve this is passwords.
Thus, design decisions in this are are important for both the usability and the 
security of the system.

During this seminar you will train your ability to comprehend and apply 
research results in the area of security and usable security.
You will combine results from different areas to analyse different aspects and 
to evaluate the security and usability of different designs.

We need Chap.~2 \enquote{Usability and Psychology} of~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
Further, we need a basic understanding of information 
theory~\cite{Shannon1948amt}, for this you are recommended to read 
\citetitle{Ueltschi2013se}~\cite{Ueltschi2013se}.
Finally, we will discuss the results of 
\citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa},
\citetitle{kelley2012guess}~\cite{kelley2012guess} and 
\citetitle{Komanduri2014can}~\cite{Komanduri2014can}.
