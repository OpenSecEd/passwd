===============================================================================

of a security course.  Its parts were developed over the years of 2012--2014 
for some courses on security in Mid Sweden University.


File structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file structure is as follows:

`pwdanalysis` is a compendium on different aspects of password analysis.

`pwdguess` is a lab for reflection on password complexity.  The students will 
get password hashes for which they should find the corresponding passwords.  It 
covers different types of hashes: unsalted LM-hashes and salted bcrypt hashes.

`pwdpolicies` is a seminar for reflection on password-composition policies.  It 
is based on research papers investigating the usability and security aspects of 
different common password composition policies.  As such it gives insights into 
the results but also the research methodologies.
